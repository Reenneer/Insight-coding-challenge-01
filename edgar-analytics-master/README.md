1) This project was executable using python 3. Additional library : numpy. It was tested under virtualenv : tensorflow. I removed virtualenv accessing and it'd be the same. Let me know if error appears.
2) This project is capable of dealing with data in large size. Currently active users are in a watching table. They are checked every second.  if response time > 2sec, they are removed from the table and put into output text file.
